# Grafana Fire Investigator

When there are massive amount of panels in your grafana, it's tired to lookup all of them and find out the root cause.

Thus I made this tampermonkey script, which automatically calculate the similarities between panels, aim to save my time.

## Use

Import the [script](https://github.com/you06/grafana-fire-investigator/blob/master/dist/index.js) into tampermonkey 

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
